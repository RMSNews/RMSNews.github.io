# Interview: Ms.Ward
### Why did you want to be a teacher?
> For as long as I can remember, from the time I was very little, I always wanted to be a teacher. So when I was little and I would play like pretend games and things like that. My mom told me that I would set up my stuffed animals and I would just yell at them because I wanted to be a teacher. So I’ve just known since I was very little, there was nothing else I wanted to do.
### Are you glad you became a teacher of the year?
> I am, I was very surprised and I felt very humbled by it and I had all the warm and fuzzy and very very thankful.
### How do you think you got teacher of the year? 
> I’m not sure. I think my strong suits are with classroom management and the relationships I have with my students then I think that goes a long way.
### Do you like being a teacher?
> I love being a teacher. It’s everything I hoped and dreamed it would be. There are hard days just like with anything else, but nothing more rewarding.
### What college did you go to?
> I went to UNC Charlotte
### What's your dream job rather than a teacher?
> If I wasn’t a teacher in the classroom I would want to be an administrator or I would want to work for professional development to help teachers be better teachers.
