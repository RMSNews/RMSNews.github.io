The Truth About Animal Testing

By Eve O’sullivan and Megan Lindsey

Did you know that every year, over 100 million animals are being tested in laboratories? These animals are being burned, crippled, poisoned, and abused, with at least 9,000 dying per year. Most countries in Europe, Israel, and India have already banned animal testing. When scientists test products for skin and eyes, they most commonly use mice, rats, rabbits and guinea pigs.

When an animal is tested, they may be exposed to harmful radiation, and some are forced to breathe in harmful chemicals. Sometimes, this results in the removal of their organs.
