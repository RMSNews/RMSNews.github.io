# Basketball

Basketball started in 1891 in Springfield, Massachusetts. The person who created basketball was a Canadian named James Naismith. He was a teacher in the YMCA (Young Men’s Christian’s Association) training school. He was required to train young men to become instructors at newly opened YMCA centers. After brainstorming some new ideas, Naismith developed basketball’s original 13 rules. That turned into the game of basketball. The first game of Basketball was played on December 21, 1891.         
James Naismith was born and raised on a farm near Almonte, Ontario. He studied physical education in Montreal McGill University, and created basketball in the early 1890’s. Naismith created basketball because it was used for a winter sport. The YMCA needed an indoor sport, and basketball turned out to be a big hit.
